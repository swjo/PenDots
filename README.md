# PenDots

*Pen Dots Algorithm was created through a process based on several experiments executed by humans and transcripted in JS5 done at the course “Input-Output” supervised by Fabian Morón Zirfas.*


First step was to write an algorithm in ‘human language' which was executed by 5 other students. 

###Version 1.0

>Draw a line in a random direction. After a while turn right. Keep on drawing and turn right again. Repeat several times. 
Line lines can cross, but they don’t have to. After several repetitions choose a new point and start again.

These were the result.

None of them was exactly what was in mind while writing these steps although all them were visually appealing. It’s interesting that it haven’t been mention that the line has to be straight and still almost everyone sticked to a straight line. 

###Version 2.0

For the second version an explicit material was added to improve the visual appearance.  

>Take a squared piece of paper and a white candle. 
Draw a line in any direction. After a while turn right. Keep on drawing an turn right again. Repeat this action serval times without removing the candle from the paper. 
The lines can cross, but they don’t have to. 
After several repetitions choose a new point and start again.
When you decide to have drawn enough line, take black ink and paint over the paper to make the lines visible. 

This algorithm was executed by 10 people in a bar. 
These were the results.

Apart from two images, the results were pretty accurate, although some people had problems with the ink. One person started to “turn”/fold the paper instead of the line and kept on painting the line over the folded paper. An other one just put a few drops on the paper and liked it so much, that she left it this way instead of painting it over to make the white lines visible. 

Version 2.1

To achieve more variety and visual freedom some of the lines where removed again.

Choose a squared piece of paper and a white candle.
Draw a random form on the paper. 
Take black ink and paint over the paper to make the lines visible. 
One person just draw the outlines and painted the form black. Others started to burn the candle and paint with the dripping wax. Every sheet of paper became different still they were untied by the material and the style. 




Translating the algorithm in p5js
The first try was to translate this system into code. The result was an inactive program. Once started it created a with form on white background. By moving the mouse the user was painting the background black until the form became visible. While clicking the mouse some sprinkle spots appeared to imitate the possibilities one has by using ink. 

Thought the goal was to write an algorithm which creates a visual appealing pattern. Therefore one of the images was picked and a new try was write a code with would create these kind of pattern. 
First tries. 
By changing the frequency and size of the dots and adding random variables different result were achieved until reaching one which was satisfying. 
How can one use it? 
3D printed this pattern could turn into original pen. Each dot turn into a black sphere connected with transparent material to keep the magic.
